# A Travel Journal

This is my first project with React. As I am learning more and more about React,
I find myself enjoying it so much more.

I Used .map() and props to map over the data to make it persistence

This travel journal has only 3 countries that I've visited, as time goes by,
I'd like to keep adding to this list.
